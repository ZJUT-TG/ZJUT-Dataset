# ZJUT-Dataset
The dataset is obtained from the three-phase asynchronous motor fault diagnosis experiment platform in Zhejiang University of Technology. The complete dataset contains nine different torsional loads and rotating speeds, only a part of which is provided in the current version, e.g. (20Hz, 0A), (30Hz, 1A), (40Hz, 2A), are available to help researchers implement and improve the method proposed in this paper. In addition, the complete dataset is available on the request of any researchers.
